# CSC560 Rewrite

## Unit I - Sharing and Storing Information (1wk)

### Reading:

1. [What is an API?](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-an-api/)

2. [API Keys and Environment Variables](https://www.netlify.com/blog/a-guide-to-storing-api-keys-securely-with-environment-variables/)

3. [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-javascript/?ref=lbp)

### Assignments:

1. Discussion Post: Consider three situations in which gathering information using an API could be used in your daily life. Consider a fourth situation in which two or more APIs could be used in conjunction with one another to serve one end.

2. Complete the GitHub tutorial at: [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/%20).

3. Create a "Hello World" program using JavaScript and upload it to your newly created repository. [This is a good place to start if you need some help](https://www.programiz.com/javascript/examples/hello-world).

## Unit II - MongoDB Setup and Intro to MERN (1wk)

### Reading:

1. [What Is The MERN Stack? Introduction & Examples | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack)

2. [Get Started With MongoDB | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/basics/get-started)

### Assignments:

1. Follow the install tutorial for MongoDB (linked above).

2. Create a MongoDB collection representing a team of players for a sport. This could be made up data or data based on a real team for a sport of your choosing--a Cricket team for instance. Once you have created your collection, create and demonstrate 5 queries that would be appropriate for your collection.

## Unit 3 - Creating an API (2wk)

### Reading:

1. [Calling an API with Postman](https://www.guru99.com/postman-tutorial.html)

2. Complete this tutorial: https://github.com/aschneider15/CSC560-Rewrite/blob/master/Node%20API/Creating%20API.md

### Assignments:

1. Install the Postman desktop application [found here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). Please note that Mac or Linux users' install links are smaller and slightly below the Windows install link. Follow the tutorial from reading 1 above, and submit a screenshot of one successful GET request and one successful POST request. Additionally, create one GET request to the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/), a Pokémon themed API. Append this given link with either the name or index number of a Pokémon (if you don't know much about Pokémon, just enter any number under 1025) and submit a screenshot of the resulting JSON.

2. Follow the tutorial from reading 2 above. Create a GitHub repository that contains the code that you wrote for the tutorial. Submit a link to the repository along with screenshots of one GET, one POST, one PATCH, and one DELETE request to the API you created using the Postman application.

## Unit 4 - Creating a Frontend (2wk)

### Reading:

1. [React + Vite installation](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

2. [React quick start guide](https://react.dev/learn)

3. [Creating a Frontend with React + Vite](https://github.com/aschneider15/CSC560-Rewrite/blob/master/Creating%20React%20%2B%20Vite%20frontend.md)

### Assignments

1. Following the guides linked above, create a simple front-end application using Node and React + Vite. The application should make a call to this public API: [https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service](https://labs.bible.org/api_web_service), and request for a random verse from the Bible every time that a button is clicked. Make an additional component which calls the API to GET a specific verse from the Bible (eg. John 3:16). This application should look appealing, but still simple: don't overdo it with the styling, just make sure it is functional. 

2. You should now begin working on your final project: create a full-stack MERN-based application that integrates all of the previous assignments into one cumulative project. The entire project should be contained within a GitHub repository, and should be well-documented. Make sure to create mindful comments throughout your code (explaining WHY you wrote things, not WHAT they do) so that you can come back to this later in your career and be able to understand and explain your project.

## Unit 5 - Final Project & Exam (2wk)

### Reading:

1. Suggestions (To be written. As a student myself, I'm hoping to provide some useful perspective on how to best complete this final project.)
   - In the API tutorial, make sure they include AXIOS in their node packages
   - Help them figure out how to pass parameters into a GET request without explicitly telling them. This should be part of Unit 4 assignment 1.
     - This will require some re-thinking of the corresponding tutorial.

### Assignments:

1. Final Project is due at the end of week seven.

2. Final Exam. Consists of ten short-answer questions based on content covered in this course.
