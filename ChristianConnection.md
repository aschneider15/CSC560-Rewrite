# Unit 1 - All About APIs

## Theme Verses

- Joel 2:32

> And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. For in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem \
> There shall be those who escape, as the Lord has said, and among the survivors shall be those whom He calls.

- 1 Corinthians 12:2-3

> You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. \
> Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says "Jesus is accursed!" \
> and no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit.

- Romans 8:25-26, 28

> But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience. Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. \
> For we do not know what to pray as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words... \
> And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to His purpose.

## Connection

> APIs allow us to access resources that would otherwise be completely impossible for us to obtain. \
> Some APIs are private, allowing only people with a key to access them, but others are free and open to everyone. \
> The most dangerous lie of this world is that anyone can be sanctified of their evil by performing good works or rituals, \
> but the truth is that unity with God isn't possible for humans to achieve. In other words, it's like a private API. \
> Fortunately for us, God has granted us access through a key: Jesus Christ. Through the power of The Holy Spirit, \
> We are able to confess that Jesus died and rose again, proving that He is the Lord of life, and "that by believing, \
> [we] may have life in His name" (John 20:31).

# Unit 2 - MongoDB Setup and Intro to MERN

## Theme Verses

- Genesis 1:11, 20, 24, 26

> And God said, 'Let the earth sprout vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their \
> seed, each according to its kind, on the earth... Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly \
> above the earth across the expanse of the heavens... Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds— \
> livestock and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds... Let us make man in our image, after our \
> likeness. And let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and the and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock \
> and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.

- Genesis 7:8-10

> Of clean animals, and of animals that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps on the ground, two and two, \
> male and female, went into the ark with Noah, as God had commanded Noah.

- Numbers 1:1-3

> The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tent of meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the \
> second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying "Take a census of all the congregation of the people of \
> Israel, by clans, by fathers' houses, according to the number of names, every male, head by head. From twenty years old \
> and upward, all in Israel who are able to go to war, you and Aaron shall list them, company by company.

## Connection

> Throughout history, it has been important for humans to keep records of things. Adam's first task on this earth was to \
> have dominion over nature, which also likely means that he categorized all of the plants and animals he saw. Noah was told \
> by God to take one male and female of every kind of animal with him aboard his giant boat, the Ark, making use of both a raven \
> and a dove to determine whether earth was dry enough to set out for land. The book of Numbers, fittingly enough, spends a large \
> portion of time focused on the census taken over all of the Israelites, counting them and identifying their duties. \
> Imagine how much easier this would have been if, instead of paper, all of these individuals had used databases!

# Unit 3 - Creating an API

## Theme Verses

- Psalm 100:1-3

> Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth! Serve the Lord with gladness! Come into his presence with singing!
> Know that the Lord, he is God! It is he who made us, and we are his; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

- 1 Corinthians 12:14-20

> For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, “Because I am not a hand, \
> I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. And if the ear should say, “Because I am not an eye, \
> I do not belong to the body,” that would not make it any less a part of the body. If the whole body were an eye, \
> where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell? But as it is, God arranged \
> the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose. If all were a single member, where would the body be? \
> As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.

## Connection

> When we created an API in this unit, we united several different packages and tools into one. MongoDB, Express, Node, Postman, \
> and all of the other packages and tools played different roles in the creation process, but they all serve one common end: \
> the successful creation and hosting of an API. The above verse from 1 Corinthians talks about the human body, and how each \
> part is unique and serves a specific purpose to the greater body. The point that St. Paul is making in this letter is that \
> Christians serving the Church at large are alike to parts of the body in this way, but this could also be said of the elements of the \
> API that we created: MongoDB and Express serve different yet equally important purposes, and we couldn't have an API with just \ 
> MongoDB or just Express: it takes all kinds of parts to make a cohesive whole. 

# Unit 4 - Creating a Frontend

## Theme Verses

- Romans 10:14-15

> How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him whom they have never heard? \
> And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, \
> "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"

- John 14:9b-10

> Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say 'Show us the Father'? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and \
> the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does His works. 

## Connection

> Through the creation of the frontend, we have given users a new way to interact with the API and the database we created. \
> In a similar way, when The Son took on flesh as Christ Jesus, we were given a way to see the Father. \
> While it was impossible to see the Father before Christ, it is still very possible to interact with an API without creating\
> an entirely new frontend user interface (remember Postman?); as always, the metaphor for spiritual things can only be extended \
> so far before being subject to heresy or losing its meaning entirely. 

# Unit 5 - Final Project & Exam

## Theme Verses

- Hebrews 12:1-3

> Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings\ 
> so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfector \
> of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand \
> of the throne of God. Consider Him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, \
> so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.

- Proverbs 16:3

> Commit your work to the Lord, and your plans will be established.

## Connection

> You've come so far in just a few weeks; now it's time to see how far. Put forth your best efforts, and continue down the path
> until it has been completed.
